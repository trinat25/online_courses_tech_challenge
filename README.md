## About
Hi, I'm Trina. I am passionate about product analytics and love diving deep into user behaviour. From the moment users discover a productâ€”whether through organic search, social media, direct visits, or referralsâ€”I aim to ensure they land on the most relevant experience.

I focus on connecting acquisition channels to user journeys, optimising the sign-up and subscription funnel, and ensuring users see value in their subscription. My goal is to leverage data to create seamless experiences that drive engagement, retention, and long-term success.

Letâ€™s build better user experiences through dataâ€”I strive to add value from day one. ðŸš€
