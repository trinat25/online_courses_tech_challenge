# Phase 1: Choosing a Statistical Test for A/B Testing  

To evaluate the impact of a new course feature on certification rates, we compare two statistical approaches:  

1. **Frequentist (Two-Proportion Z-Test)** ‚Äì A standard hypothesis test that requires a pre-defined sample size.  
2. **Bayesian (Beta-Binomial)** ‚Äì Provides a probability that the treatment outperforms the control, allowing for continuous monitoring.  

I recommend the **Bayesian approach** as it delivers **more intuitive and actionable results**, avoiding rigid significance thresholds.

## üî¨ Hypothesis for Each Approach  

| **Approach**  | **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))** | **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))** |
|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Frequentist (Z-Test)** | The certification rate of treatment (B) is **less than or equal to** the control (A). \(H_0: p_B \leq p_A\) | The certification rate of treatment (B) is **higher** than control (A). \(H_1: p_B > p_A\) |
| **Bayesian (Beta-Binomial)** | No strict \(H_0\), instead we calculate the probability that B is better than A. | Computes \( P(B > A) \), which gives the probability that B outperforms A. |

## üî¨ Frequentist Test (Two-Proportion Z-Test)  
- **Z-Score**: **1.95**  
- **P-Value**: **0.0506**  
- **Lift Estimate**: **+13.75%**  
- **95% CI for Lift**: **(7.56%, 19.93%)**  
- **Conclusion**: *Fail to reject null hypothesis (p = 0.0506)*  

> ‚ùì *Does this mean B is not better than A?*  
Not necessarily. The result suggests **insufficient evidence at p = 0.05**, but does not rule out a real effect.  

---

## üéØ Bayesian Test (Beta-Binomial)  
- **Posterior Mean for A**: **0.4495** (~44.95% certification rate)  
- **Posterior Mean for B**: **0.5110** (~51.10% certification rate)  
- **Probability B is better than A**: **99.71%**  
- **Conclusion**: *High confidence that B outperforms A (P = 0.9971)*  

> ‚úÖ **Why Bayesian?**  
- More **intuitive**: Instead of a p-value, we get **P(B > A) = 99.71%**, which is easier for stakeholders to understand.  
- **No fixed sample size needed** ‚Äì results can be monitored continuously without inflating false positives.  
- Avoids arbitrary significance thresholds.

## üîç Are the Outcomes Different?  

At first glance, the two approaches might seem to give different conclusions, but they actually answer **different questions**:

| **Method**  | **Question Being Answered** | **Outcome** |
|------------|----------------------------|------------|
| **Frequentist (Z-Test)** | *"Is the observed difference significant at p < 0.05?"* | **No (p = 0.0506 is slightly above the threshold)** |
| **Bayesian** | *"What is the probability that B is better than A?"* | **Very high (99.71%)** |

**Key Takeaways:**  
- The **frequentist approach** relies on a **fixed p-value threshold (0.05)**, meaning results can be inconclusive even if a real effect exists.  
- The **Bayesian approach** does not depend on rejecting a null hypothesis but **quantifies our confidence** that B is better than A.  
- **Final decision-making is easier with Bayesian results** because we can communicate a probability rather than a statistical rejection rule.

## üîç Key Takeaways  

| Aspect  | Frequentist (Z-Test) | Bayesian (Beta-Binomial) |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Interpretability** | P-value (0.0506) | **P(B > A) = 99.71%** |
| **Lift Estimate** | (7.56%, 19.93%) | No direct CI, but probability-based |
| **Decision Making** | Fixed sample size, no early stopping | Flexible, but requires monitoring for stopping bias |
| **Business Impact** | Harder to explain | **More actionable for product teams** |

**Recommendation**: Bayesian testing offers a **clearer probability-based decision framework**, making it the preferred choice for business decision-making. However, ensuring a **minimum test duration** is critical to avoid premature conclusions.

## üèÜ Beyond the Test: What Makes a Practical Analyst?  
Selecting the right statistical method is **just one part** of impactful A/B testing. A great analyst also considers:  

1. **Test Worthiness** ‚Äì Is the expected uplift meaningful? Is the audience large enough?  
2. **Business Context** ‚Äì Are there **seasonality effects** or other confounding factors?  
3. **Secondary Metrics** ‚Äì Does certification rate improvement come at the expense of revenue, engagement, or churn?  
4. **Influence & Communication** ‚Äì Can results be translated into **clear, actionable insights** for decision-makers?  

**Conclusion:** Bayesian testing is a strong choice, but **a great analyst ensures the test is set up for success beyond just statistics**.
